      review:"I'm a huge fan of Gears 1-3. I loved horde mode, the story and the multiplayer but Gears 4 just felt like they got lazy and copy and pasted all the gameplay and features from 3. The story is very weak and uninteresting I couldn't even get through 2 hours of it. Multiplayer just felt like a throwback to gears 3 there wasn't anything special or different to it, and the shotguns are constantly being spammed if you can't use a shotgun effectively then you lose. Horde just feels the same as the original and the classes feel restrictive. If you haven't played any of the previous gears then it's worth the 60 dollars otherwise I don't see it being worth that much."},

      review:"Got this for my 12 year-old son for Christmas, and the gamer in me came back out to play as we spent hours in 2-player mode (there's a girl character, which I of course loved), bashing monsters, chainsawing locusts and fighting our way through the crazy awesomeness that is Gears of War 4. One of the best games I've played. Reminded me of my other fave, Rise of the Tomb Raider, in terms of graphics and how fun the battle scenes were. We got through fairly quickly - the only downside - and can't wait to go back through on Insane mode. Tons and tons of fun!!"}
